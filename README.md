# Vitomir Humor & Insight

A small collection of Vitomir-inspired wisdom and humor: short jokes, one-liners, and tiny sketches that pair insight with a wink. Use these as prompts, micro-essays, or lighthearted epigrams.

Structure
- `jokes/` — Markdown files containing joke/wisdom sets.
- `sketches/` — Optional images or diagrams illustrating a joke.

Enjoy — and feel free to expand the collection.

# AI & Human Wit

- "AI writes the punchline; humans teach it timing. Together, they make mischief."
- "When the algorithm compliments you, thank the training set."
- "Human wit: context. AI wit: rapid rehearsal. Mix generously."

Tiny notes:
- Playful contrasts between machine speed and human warmth.
